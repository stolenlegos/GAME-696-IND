“Hey there, bud!” A soothing voice rushes over your ears. 

It’s calm and comforting, a warm blanket for the soul, which is perfect for you, since that is all you are at the moment. You look up to see the source of the voice. 

&lt;img src=&#39;https://iliasimagegallery.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/searchingforastyle.png&#39;height=&#39;500px&#39;&gt;

Before you, a bright being of spectral warmth and love looks down at you with its gentle face. Its hand reaches down, clasps your face, and [[scratches-&gt;Prologue 1]] behind your ear.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Prologue 2" tags="" position="273,59" size="100,100">The spirit sees the confusion in your eye. 

“Oh! You must be a new one. I don’t get many new ones. Usually I just deal with repeats. Guess I’ll have to break out the script for a change.” The spirit removes its hand and stands up. 

“I am the Shepherd,” its hands gesture toward you, “and you are one of my many… well, I’ll say children. [[Pets-&gt;Prologue 3]] seems too...reductive.” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Prologue 4" tags="" position="514,56" size="100,100">The revelation washes over you. Your wagging tail. Your low, four-legged stature. The subtle feeling of fur across your body. You are, in fact, a dog. 

Well, the soul of a dog, anyway. The discovery is...comforting. You have an [[understanding of yourself-&gt;Prologue 5]] , or at least an understanding of your being. Your purpose, however, is still up in the air. The Shepherd smiles at you again.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Prologue 5" tags="" position="635,56" size="100,100">“I see you’re understanding it now! That’s good bud, that’s really good.” The Shepherd sits down on the ground, its face now level with yours. 

“Now, if I had things my way, you would stay here with me and we would have a grand old time,” the spirit scratches behind your ear again, “but if I do that, then I disrupt the Hierarchy, and since some of them are already mad at me anyway,” the spirit shakes its head, smiling “then the best thing to do is my job, which means making sure that you fulfill your [[purpose-&gt;Prologue 6]] as a dog.”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Prologue 6" tags="" position="757,54" size="100,100">Purpose. The word is heavy in the air. But the weight is good. It’s something you want, something you need, and though you don’t know exactly why, you excitedly wait for the Shepherd to explain it to you.

The Shepherd stands and clasps its hands together. “Well, time to get back on track. We’ve already gone over that you are a dog, but now it is important to understand what that means.” 

The spirit unclasps its hands to reveal a swirl of light in front of you. The light forms into images: wolves and humans hunting together in the early annals of [[history-&gt;Prologue 7]], dogs herding sheep in medieval fields, dogs pulling sleds through deep snow from town to town, and all between it, dogs spending time with their human companions, living their lives completely for their human counterpart. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Prologue 8" tags="" position="1018,50" size="100,100">The Shepherd waves its hands and the images disappear. “That is your purpose,” The spirit kneels down again, “to find and provide companionship to a human. It isn’t always easy to do, but usually everything falls into place. But the best way to provide companionship to another,” the Shepherd clasps its hands once again and then pulls them apart, revealing a pencil and clipboard, “is to understand oneself. 

So bud, I have some [[questions-&gt;Prologue 9]] for you.”

That’s good! Bringing energy is important, and energetic dogs are the source of much joy for humans.” 

The Shepherd leans in a bit closer. “Remember though, one-hundred percent energy isn’t the answer one-hundred percent of the time. Your human will need to pace themselves and so will you.” 

The Shepherd taps the top of your head. “But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]]&quot;

It’s a point made in human culture that dogs are the most loyal animals that a human can own, so you’re definitely hitting a key mark with that.” 

The Shepherd leans in a bit closer. “But remember, while loyalty is important, it doesn’t do a lot of good without action to back it up. Standing by your owner is one thing. Helping them through their troubles is something else entirely.” 

The Shepherd taps the top of your head. “But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]]”

In the human world, taking care of your dog is seen as a noble act, but dogs take care of humans just as much as humans take care of dogs!” 

The Shepherd leans in a bit closer. “Just don’t be all caring, all the time. While it is important to care for your owner, you must also just be their friend. Let them enjoy your presence and have fun.” The Shepherd taps the top of your head. 

“But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]] ”

- Josh Billings</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="  Chapter 1: 2" tags="" position="155,513" size="100,100">You open your eyes the moment the light hits them. It&#39;s early morning, but you’ve become an early bird. Your family isn’t the same. Your mother and siblings lay about you on the ground, snoring the dawn away. You on the other hand pop your head up and look out at the dawn. 

The sun peaks above the trees and covers the field in golden rays of light. The mud on the dirt road leading up to the house shines from the dewy morning. The [[lights of a car-&gt;Chapter 1: 3]] come into view.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Prologue 1" tags="" position="158,60" size="100,100">Your leg shakes involuntarily.

“Oh that’s the spot right, bud! That’s the spot right there.” The spirit smiles as you continue to shake. Your tail wags behind you…

Wait.

[[Your tail?-&gt;Prologue 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Prologue 3" tags="" position="393,59" size="100,100">You turn your head. “Pets?” you think to yourself. “Me, a pet?” 

The Shepherd catches the question on your face. “Yeah bud! You,” the spirit taps your head, “are the spirit of an animal. Or, more accurately, you are the spirit of one of the most beloved animals in all of human history.” 

Your tail wags involuntarily. The Shepherd laughs, “That’s right, bud! [[You’re a dog!-&gt;Prologue 4]]&quot; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Prologue 7" tags="" position="875,54" size="100,100">
The Shepherd smiles again as the images play out before both of you. “For generations, humans and dogs have been intertwined, their lives lived inseparably from one another. While the approach and context for each distinct relationship is very different, the purpose of it, the love and companionship, always finds its way through. Sometimes it does not always start out that way, but what is certain is that humans and dogs will always, at some point, find [[companionship-&gt;Prologue 8]]  with one another.” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Prologue 15" tags="" position="180,243" size="100,100">The Shepherd walks over and picks you up, your legs flailing a bit as it does. “Oh, uh, you can float by the way.” 

The Shepherd lets you go. Your body hangs in the air, your eyes watching the Shepherd as it takes its staff in both hands and thrusts it toward the sky. The space is pierced by a glowing golden portal. As you stare at it, the Shepherd grabs your face and looks you in the eye. 

“You’re gonna be a great dog, okay? You’re gonna make someone very happy. And who knows, maybe you’ll do it again and again. Now, up you go!” The Shepherd takes your body and throws you up into the portal. [[Your vision starts to spin-&gt; Chapter 1: 1]] as the portal sucks you through, and the last thing you see is the Shepherd waving at you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Chapter 1: 3" tags="" position="293,516" size="100,100">Someone’s here this early? That’s strange. In your short life, you haven’t seen anyone come to get a dog from the farm this early.

Will is one of the few humans you routinely interact with. 

He’s a nice man; he feeds you, cleans up after you, and makes sure your brothers and sisters don’t bite you too much. You watch as he walks towards the oncoming car, its [[driver-&gt;  Chapter 1: 5]] slowing to a stop and getting out as Will reaches the driver side door. 

Will shakes the driver’s hand like he’s an old friend and they make their way over to where you are.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="  Chapter 1: 5" tags="" position="555,518" size="100,100">Will opens the door to your pen. “...best (fill in variable: dog breed)s you’ll find anywhere. I can promise you that.” 

The driver laughs. “That’s why I came all this way. Gotta get the best from here back to home before my boy wakes up.” 

Will swings open the cover on the pen, revealing you and your family to the early morning light. Your brothers and sisters squirm a bit and begin to wake as you stare up at the driver. 

Will begins to explain the intricacies of your breed: how best to take care of you, what you like and don’t like, and everything in between. The whole time you stare at the driver, and eventually [[he looks down at you.-&gt;Chapter 1: 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Chapter 1: 6" tags="" position="676,521" size="100,100">“Aw, this one seems to be ready to go.” The driver reaches toward you with his hand and pats your head.

“First one up should probably be the first one served.” Will nods. “This one has been itching to get out of the pen for a long while. I think you’d give ‘em a good home.” 

The driver nods back. “Yeah, I think I would too.” He looks back down at you. “What do you say, bud, wanna come home with me?”

After a bit of a lengthy process, you find yourself [[inside a car-&gt;Chapter 1: 9]] on the way to your new home. 

The driver looks down at you before starting the car. “Gosh, I know Will is going to love you. I just know it.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Chapter 1: 9" tags="" position="844,801" size="100,100">It’s a long ride to your new home.

You arrive at the driver&#39;s house in the middle of the day. With you in one arm, he opens the door to reveal a quaint foyer with a hall going down toward a doorway. 

Standing in the doorway, a woman holds her hands over the [[eyes of a small boy.-&gt;Chapter 1: 11]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Chapter 1: 11" tags="" position="1106,812" size="100,100">“Can I open them now?” The boy’s voice is impatient. 

“Yes honey, you can.” 

The boy opens his eyes and he screams. “You got me a dog!! A dog! For me!!!!” The driver laughs. 

“Yeah Will,” he places you down onto the floor, “Now come meet your new friend.” The boy races over to you, his hands wrapping around you as soon as he reaches you. He’s warm. Very warm. Warm beyond just body heat. He’s known you for seconds and he already loves you. 

He cups your face in his hands and looks at you with deep green eyes. “We’re gonna have so much fun! So much fun!!” He looks up at the driver and back at the woman. “Thanks Dad! Thanks Mom!”

He calls for his mom who rushes into the room. “I can’t find [[Captain Beam-&gt;Chapter 1: 13.1]]!” Will cries at his mother as she wraps her arms around him. “It’s okay honey, we’ll find him. He’s the blue one right? I know he’s your favorite.”

Your eyes flutter open at the sound of the lock turning. From your dog bed, you look up at the window, a low morning light shining through. Your eyes adjust to the light quickly; you’ve been woken up like this before.}

When [[your owner, Mike-&gt;Chapter 2: 2]], got you as a puppy, he made it very clear that he would always be up and out before you, and that by the time he got home everyday you would just be waking up. 

You thought it was funny that he would bother telling this to you, given that you can’t agree or disagree with it. You’re a dog. You go with the flow, and you’ve been going with Mike’s flow for four years.

You walk into the kitchen to greet Mike. “Hey buddy!” He pets you and scratches behind your ear. “Today’s a big day. We’re getting a new roommate.” 

[[A new roommate-&gt;Chapter 2: 3]]? Oh yeah, you remember now. Mike’s old roommate Bill moved because of work, and there’s no way Mike can stay in an apartment like this just by himself. Maybe the new roommate will have a dog too?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Chapter 2: 3" tags="" position="1457,1097" size="100,100">At that thought, there is a knock on the door. Mike is startled. “Huh, wonder who that could be.” He goes over and answers the door, you right in step right behind him. 

Opening the door reveals a human, just out of college like Mike, his blue eyes somewhat red. “Oh jeez Will, I wasn’t expecting you yet. Is everything okay? You don’t look great?” Will steps into the kitchen, his body trembling. You go over and lick his hand. He seems familiar. 

Will can’t look Mike in the eye. “Man...I...uh,” he looks down at you and manages a small smile, “Hey,” he pats you, “how’s it going...uh...what’s the dog&#39;s name again, Mike?”

You walk out of the kitchen toward Mike’s room, making your way to your bed. You lay on your bed, [[listening to the conversation-&gt;Chapter 2: 6]] in the kitchen.

You hear phrases like “She did what?!” and “You’ll find someone better, man” from Mike, using the same calm voice he uses when trying to make you feel better when you are upset. 

The conversation goes on and on, a seemingly never ending amount of emotion sifting through the kitchen through the living room and finding its way right in front of you. [[You can feel Will-&gt;Chapter 2: 7]] more than Mike, though you don’t know why.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Chapter 2: 7" tags="" position="852,1098" size="100,100">After a while, Mike enters the room and comes over to you. Will isn’t with him, and you assume he must still be in the kitchen or maybe in the living room. 

“Hey $nameTwo, my buddy Will isn’t doing too well, alright? He needs some company, but I gotta go and set up a few things for him so he can start his move in process, okay? So,” he cups your head in his hands, “I’m gonna need you to [[be Will’s friend-&gt;Chapter 2: 8]], alright? Can you do that?” You bark excitedly. Of course you can. You’re a dog.

Will looks up at Mike and nods. “Uh, yeah that’s good with me.” Mike clasps his hands together. “Awesome! [[You two have fun-&gt;Chapter 2: 9]]. I’ll be back as soon as I can.” 

You watch Mike grab his coat and leave the apartment.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Chapter 2: 9" tags="" position="549,1105" size="100,100">You turn back to Will.

He keeps [[looking at this phone-&gt;Chapter 2: 10.2]], cradling it in his hand like it’s a little puppy that will eventually come alive for him. 

Every time it vibrates, he quickly looks through it, then breathes out a sad sigh and puts it back down near his lap. You walk up to him and sit down near his feet, nudging your nose against his leg. He looks up at you with a small thin smile. 

“Hey $nameTwo. How’s it going? You’re probably doing better than me, huh?” He lays his head back [[on the couch-&gt;Chapter 2: 10.1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="Chapter 2: 10.3" tags="" position="555,978" size="100,100">You go over to your dog toy bin.

You’re bigger than him in this position, but only somewhat, and eventually [[you find a spot that is comfortable-&gt;Chapter 2: 10.1.2]] for both him and you. 

As it happens, Will sits stunned, not sure whether to move or pet you or anything until finally, after you settle in, you feel his hand go across your fur.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="Chapter 2: 10.1.2" tags="" position="239,1107" size="100,100">“Thanks $nameTwo.

As you lie there, you feel a slight drip of something on your fur as Will starts to cry again, burying his face into your body. You don’t mind it. Despite the sadness, he still feels warm. A familiar warmth. Something you don’t really get with Mike. 

He cries for a while as you lay there, [[waiting for Mike-&gt;CHapter 2: 11]] to come home.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Chapter 2: 10.2a" tags="" position="327,868" size="100,100"> You grab the TV remote in your mouth and carry it over to Will.

 “You’re a weird $ch1Breed, you know that?” He takes the remote in his hand. “You know what, you’re right. Let’s watch some TV.” Will turns the TV on and flips through the channels, eventually ending on a rebroadcast of an old pro wrestling show. “This stuff is fake but it’s kinda fun, honestly,” Will says out loud. You bark in response.
 
 “Haha, you get what I’m talking about, don’t you $nameTwo?” You jump up on the couch, watching TV with Will [[until Mike gets home-&gt;CHapter 2: 11]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Chapter 2: 10.2b" tags="" position="299,983" size="100,100"> You grab the Playstation controller in your mouth and carry it over to Will.

“Mike teaches you weird stuff. You’re strange for a $ch1Breed, you know that?” He takes the controller and turns on the Playstation. “Oh, Mike has God of War! Always wanted to play that.”

“Yeah, yeah we did. $nameTwo is a pretty incredible dog, Mike.” Mike laughs. “Yeah I know. A bit of a handful sometimes, but definitely one hell of a dog. 

Now come on, some of your [[stuff is here-&gt;Chapter 2: 12]] and we gotta carry up four flights of stairs.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Chapter 2: 10.3a" tags="" position="374,745" size="100,100">You grab your favorite ball and bring it over to Will.

There’s not really anywhere to play inside.” You take the ball and run around in circles in front of Will. 

“I mean, I guess I can throw it in here, if that’s what you want.” Will starts to throw the ball to you. It isn’t quite like playing fetch outside, but you enjoy yourself, and you see that same enjoyment on Will’s face with each throw of the ball.

Will continues to throw the ball to you [[until Mike returns-&gt;CHapter 2: 11]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Chapter 2: 10.3b" tags="" position="434,873" size="100,100">You grab your favorite rope and drag it towards Will, placing one end of it up on his lap.

“Alright $nameTwo, fine. Let&#39;s see what you got.” Will starts to tug on his end of the rope as you drag it around on the ground, nearly pulling him off the couch. 

He pulls back hard and, for a long while, you both battle for control of the rope [[until Mike returns-&gt;CHapter 2: 11]].

Eventually, the day comes where [[Will has to move out-&gt;Chapter 2: 13]]. You overhear Mike and Will talking in the kitchen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Chapter 2: 13" tags="" position="82,848" size="100,100">“Are you sure Mike?

“Okay, if you insist.” You walk out into the kitchen and both Mike and Will look at you. Will kneels down and pats the top of your head. “I don’t know if you just heard, $nameTwo, but you’re coming with me.” 

From that day, you lived out your time with Will, spending time with him as he navigated his young life.

Will keeps close behind her, looking at each dog and asking questions about their background, how long they’ve been in the shelter, and other things. Eventually, they make their way to you. 

Before Amber has time to talk about you, Will steps up, leans down and looks you in the eye. “What’s this one’s name?”

“No, I’m fine. I want $nameThree.” Amber lights up. 

“Oh! Okay! Great, well, I just need to go get my supervisor to go through the process of [[adoption-&gt;Chapter 3: 7]]. I’m just a volunteer, so I can’t really do any of that.” She laughs. Will walks past her to the door.

A pair of groans come down from upstairs, followed by a female “oookaaaayyyy.” You watch as two children turn the corner at the top of the stairs and look down at you, their eyes lighting up at the sight of you. 

“A dog!” They yell in unison. “You got us a dog!!!” They rush down stairs and nearly tackle you off your feet, their hands moving all around your body as they hug you. Will grabs them both by the shoulders. 

“Hey, hey, hey. $nameThree is a rescue, so you gotta be gentle, alright?” The kids back off a bit.

For the next few hours, you play with the children, running around the yard, playing [[fetch-&gt;Chapter 3: 11.1]] and wrestling with them until dusk. 

As the kids mom calls them in for dinner, you see Will [[leaning against the fence-&gt;Chapter 3: 11.2]]. The kids rush back inside and you [[trot up to Will-&gt;ChaptChapter 3: 11.3]] as he looks out over the fence.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="Chapter 3: 11.1" tags="" position="1455,1625" size="100,100">On your way over, you grab the ball the kids were throwing to you. You drop it at Will’s feet and he looks down at you. “You still wanna play a bit, huh? Looks like $ch2Breed’s are harder to tire out than I thought. Well come on, let’s play a bit more.” 

Will takes the ball off the ground and throws it to the other side of the yard. You rush over, pick it up and bring it back to him. Each throw feels natural. Feels right. You feel like you’ve played fetch with Will dozens of times, but you just can’t put your paw on why. 

You look over at the backdoor to see Will’s wife standing in the doorway, smiling. “Honey, if you stay out there too long, dinner will get cold.” Will laughs a bit and turns to her. 

“Yeah, I know. I’m coming in.” He looks at you. “Come one $nameThree, [[let’s go inside-&gt;Chapter 3: 12]].”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="Chapter 3: 11.2" tags="" position="1454,1495" size="100,100">You jump up next to Will, putting your paws right where his hands are on the fence. You can’t quite look over the fence, so you look at Will. He smiles. “You’re a weird $ch2Breed, you know that?” 

You bark at Will. He laughs. “Okay, okay. You wanna stand like a human? That’s fine. Let me give you a rundown of the neighborhood.” For the next few minutes, Will starts pointing out to you where other dogs live in the neighborhood, what neighbors he likes and doesn’t like, and the best places to go for walks. All the places he points out seem so familiar to you, yet you can’t figure out why. 

You hear Will’s wife laugh behind you. “You’re showing the dog the neighborhood, honey?” Will laughs nervously to himself. 

“Yeah, I guess.” Will’s wife comes up and puts her hand on his shoulder. “Come on, [[let’s go inside-&gt;Chapter 3: 12]]. Dinner’s gonna get cold.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="ChaptChapter 3: 11.3" tags="" position="1437,1360" size="100,100">You walk over to Will and sit down at his feet, resting your head over his toes. It startles him a bit, but he moves his feet and kneels down. 

“You’re a good dog, aren’t you. Just a good, kind dog. Some people say that $ch2Breed’s can’t be calm, but you’re here to prove them wrong I guess.” Will sits on the grass and starts to pat your head, his hand heavy but gentle. 

You look up at him and pant, then pull your head closer to his lap. He cups your head in his hands. “I’m so glad I got you. You’ll make the kids so happy.” You hear steps from behind you. 

“Hasn’t even been here a day and you’re already too distracted,” Will&#39;s wife laughs. Will stands up. “You know me, honey. I just hope the kids will have as much fun as I did when I was younger.” Will’s wife grabs his arm and takes him toward the back door. 

“Don’t worry, they will. Now come on, [[let’s get inside-&gt;Chapter 3: 12]] before dinner gets cold.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="Chapter 3: 12" tags="" position="1623,1488" size="100,100">You make your way inside with Will and his wife. The kids have set up a bowl for you, $nameThree written on the side of it in crude marker. 

You eat and listen as Will and his family enjoy their dinner above you. You look forward to more days like this. They come. They go. Eventually, after so many years, time catches up with you, and [[you close your eyes-&gt;Chapter 4: 1]]…

“This...this is interesting.” The Shepherd&#39;s voice caresses your ears as you awaken. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen something like this before.” You look up. The clipboard is already in his hand and he seems to be writing something down.}

He looks at you and smiles. “Ah, you’re awake. Good, good. Seems like you had another successful run, didn’t you?” You see blue eyes in front of you, then they’re gone. “Seems like you’ve built up quite the connection, haven’t you? Well, that’s good! You’re doing your job as a dog and that’s what matters.” 

You see the golden portal open behind the Shepherd. “Now, I know I always seem to be rushing you, but I promise that’s not what I want to happen. But the process has to keep moving, okay?” He holds out the clipboard.

The hand’s skin is soft and smooth as it roughly moves its way across your body. You&#39;re used to getting woken up this way. Will’s grandchildren have a tendency to not be very considerate when it comes to you sleeping. 

“Hey, leave the dog alone, will yah!” Will’s voice is forceful but pained from the other room. His grandchild steps away from you. 

“Sorry grandpa Will,” she says. She starts to make back toward the sound of Will’s voice, looking at you as she goes. “Come on...uh...grandpa Will!?” 

“Yeah!?” Will responds. “What’s the dog’s name again?”

I’ve told yah a thousand times!” Will’s granddaughter laughs and looks at you, “I know your name, I’m just messing with grandpa.” She turns and goes into the other room, beckoning you to follow. 

You feel the strain throughout your body as you get up. You’re old, very, very old. You’ve lived your life in a few different houses, eventually landing in a shelter near the end of your life. You had heard the volunteers talking about how you couldn’t stay very long, about how “it would be [[time to go soon-&gt;Chapter 4: 5]],” but you didn’t know what that meant. 

Then one day, Will arrived and took you away from the shelter and brought you to his home. It’s been a little over two years since then, but living with Will has been good.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="94" name="Chapter 4: 5" tags="" position="1203,1866" size="100,100">You walk over toward the room where Will’s granddaughter went. On the way, you can hear Will’s son talking with him. “Dad, you just... I want you to take care of yourself, okay?” “I am taking care of myself Parker,” there’s a slight pain in Will’s voice, “I don’t need any live-in nurse or anything like that.” You hear Will’s son sigh. “Dad, last week alone we had to come over and help you get up after a fall. I know you think that everything is fine but we can’t keep coming by to help just cause the neighbors hear $nameFour barking so loud.” Will’s voice rises. “That dog has done more for me than you’ll ever know, Parker.” Parker sighs, “I know, I know. It’s just..[[we care about you-&gt;Chapter 4: 6]], Dad, and I don’t want something bad to happen to you, especially something preventable.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="Chapter 4: 6" tags="" position="1063,1867" size="100,100">At that you arrive at your old [[torn up ball-&gt;Chapter 4: 7.1]] near [[Will’s feet-&gt;Chapter 4: 7.2]], your body finally adjusting to being awake. 

You look up at Parker, then at Will. [[Will looks down at you-&gt;Chapter 4: 7.3]] as Parker places a folder on the table.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="96" name="Chapter 4: 7.1" tags="" position="913,2017" size="100,100">You pick up the ball at Will’s feet and look up at him, your legs struggling a bit at the shifting of your body. Will laughs to himself and looks at Parker. “See, even $nameFour wants me to still go.” He reaches a hand down and pets you. 

“You’re a good $ch3Breed, yes you are.” Parker sighs and smiles. “That dog is just as stubborn as you are, Dad… but I’m glad you have a companion like that.” Will smiles at Parker. 

“So am I… look, Parker, I’m sorry to get angry with you, I just don’t like having to deal with old age like this. Maybe you’re right, maybe I do need some help, but I want to get it on my own accord, like I did with $nameFour.” Parker puts a hand on Will’s shoulder. 

“Alright Dad, alright. Just let me know when you make that decision and I can help you with it, okay.” Will hugs Parker. 

“Okay, I will. [[Now get going-&gt;Chapter 4: 8]]. You said little Katie had a soccer game, right.” Parker nods. 

“Yeah. I’ll see you later dad.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Chapter 4: 7.2" tags="" position="1063,2017" size="100,100">You go over and look up at Will. He looks down at you. As your eyes meet, you start to bark at him. It’s a low but forceful bark, vibrating the floor below you. Parker chuckles a bit. 
 
“I think $nameFour agrees with me.” Will scoffs at Parker. “I do believe I would know if my own dog betrayed me like that. I think that bark is meant for you.” Parker puts his hand on his dads shoulder. “Look Dad, regardless who the bark is for, I think $nameFour gets that there is something wrong, and you gotta fix it.” 
 
Will sighs, “Yeah, maybe you’re right. I just...getting old is tough Parker. It’s hard to look at life and think you need assistance with everything you do. I don’t like that having that power taken away from me,” Will looks down at you, “I feel like ever since I got $nameFour, I’ve gotten some of that power back.” Parker hugs Will. 
 
“I know Dad. I know. We don’t want to take anything from you. We just want you to live these last years to the fullest, alright?” 
 
Will breathes out slowly, “Yeah...yeah, I know. [[Shouldn’t you be getting going-&gt;Chapter 4: 8]], by the way? I remember you said little Katie had a soccer game.” Parker lets go of Will. “Yeah she does. We’ll get out of your hair.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="98" name="Chapter 4: 7.3" tags="" position="1213,2017" size="100,100"> You go over to Will and lay right at his feet, your body welcoming the rest from the walk over from your bed. Will looks down at you and sighs. “You’re tired of Parker too, aren’t you $nameFour?” Parker looks down at you too, staring at your legs as they splay out before you. 
 
 “No Dad, I think $nameFour is just...tired.” Will reaches down and pats you on the head. 
 
 “Yeah...yeah, me too. I’m...sorry I got angry with you Parker. It’s hard, getting older, watching the days get shorter and shorter as my body just can’t keep up.” Will leans back in his chair, his hand drifting away from you. “And you’re probably right, I probably do need someone to help me during the day. It’s just...I don’t like giving up the little bit of freedom I have left.” 
 
 Parker leans in and hugs Will. “I know Dad, I know. I don’t want you to give it up either. But I also don’t want you to die anytime soon. Just...just promise me you’ll think about it, okay?” 
 
 Will hugs his son tighter. “I will.” He let’s go. “Hey, [[shouldn’t you be heading out soon-&gt;Chapter 4: 8]]? I know you said that little Katie had a soccer game to go to.” 
 
 Parker nods. “Yeah, you’re right. We should head out. I’ll see you later, okay Dad?”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="Chapter 4: 8" tags="" position="1068,2167" size="100,100">Parker turns and walks toward the front hall, calling for Katie as he does. Katie runs in and says goodbye to you and Will, kissing Will on the cheek and you on the forehead. As they leave, Will stares at them through the window. 

“We’re just a couple of [[old dogs-&gt;Chapter 4: 9]], aren’t we $nameFour?” You look up at him, your mind wanting you to bark but your body deciding you are too tired to do it. Will gets up from his chair, grabs the folder from the table and goes to his bedroom. 

“Come on, $nameFour. You can stay in my room today.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="Chapter 4: 9" tags="" position="896,2152" size="100,100">As you enter the room behind Will, you watch him go toward a dresser and pull a binder out of the top drawer. Will then turns and sits down on the chair at the foot of the bed, opens the binder and starts looking through it. 

You walk up next to him and sit, trying to get a [[look at the binder-&gt;Chapter 4: 10]]. Will notices your curiosity. 

“Ah, you wanna see what I’m looking at? Sure, I’ll show you.” He turns the binder toward you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Chapter 4: 10" tags="" position="756,2146" size="100,100">In it, you see dozens of pictures of someone. A young boy, then a young man, then an older man. All of them have dogs. In the boys photo, you see him running around with a $prologueBreed, while in the young mans photos, you see him playing fetch with a $ch2Breed. 

Finally, in the older man’s photos, you see a $ch3Breed standing with him and his family. “You see, these are all the dogs I’ve ever had. That there is $nameOne, and that one is $nameTwo, and that right there is $nameThree. 
But don’t worry $nameFour, [[you’ll be in here too-&gt;CHapter 4: 11]].”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="CHapter 4: 11" tags="" position="601,2132" size="100,100">Will takes the folder that he had gotten off the table and takes out photos of you and him and the rest of his family. “I made sure Parker took these.” He rubs his finger across them as he puts them into the binder. 

“Now you’re in there too, with all my best friends.” He pats you on the head, yawning. “Huh, tired at this hour? I am getting old.” He gets up from the chair and moves to his bed. “Alright bud, I’m gonna take a nap.” Will lays down and reaches a hand down toward your head. 

“You can lie there if you want, that’s alright. I’ll be up soon.” You lie under his hand, your eyes fluttering shut as sleep overtakes you.

You hear a voice inside your head. “You’re a good dog. [[You did well-&gt;Epilogue 1]], so sleep well.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Epilogue 1" tags="" position="546,1752" size="100,100">You open your eyes to the sight of the Shepherd. He reaches a hand down away from you, and you watch as a golden portal opens up, taking an animal spirit with it.

“Well, I think that one will have a lot of fun being a monkey.” He chuckles to himself and looks over at you. “Oh! You’re awake. Wonderful.” He walks over to you and kneels down, placing his hand on your head. 

“So this time is gonna be a little bit different, okay? This time...well, there isn’t really a this time.” He smiles and picks you up, turning to face a golden sea of a field. “You see, sometimes, some spirits like you are just so good, that we decide to give them a break,” he places you down on the ground, “now go on. [[Go and take a break-&gt;Epilogue 2]].” 

You run out into the field. Despite your spectral form, you can feel the wind on your face, the rush and feel of the golden grass against your body. You feel alive.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="Epilogue 2" tags="" position="411,1757" size="100,100">The Shepherd watches as the spirit plays before him, turning when he senses the presence behind him. He smiles. “They let you come and see them? Didn’t expect that.” Will’s spirit laughs. 

“Yeah, I think the guys upstairs felt the connection when they were checking me in. Nice of them to give me a bit of time just to see them one last time.” 

The Shepherd puts an arm around Will’s shoulder and points out to [[the field-&gt;Epilogue 3]]. “Well, there they are. All before you, all as one.” 

Will smiles. “Best damn dog in the world.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="Epilogue 3" tags="" position="275,1762" size="100,100">You turn and watch as a light fades away from the Shepherd. Running over, you feel yourself wishing you had turned sooner, but you don’t quite know why. 

You stop at the feet of the Shepherd and sit. He looks down and smiles. “What is it bud? Do you want to [[go again-&gt;Prologue Opening]]?”
