“Hey there, bud!” A soothing voice rushes over your ears. It’s calm and comforting, a warm blanket for the soul, which is perfect for you, since that is all you are at the moment. You look up to see the source of the voice. Before you, a bright being of spectral warmth and love looks down at you with its gentle face. Its hand reaches down, clasps your face, and [[scratches-&gt;Prologue 1]] behind your ear.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Prologue 2" tags="" position="273,59" size="100,100">The spirit sees the confusion in your eye. “Oh! You must be a new one. I don’t get many new ones. Usually I just deal with repeats. Guess I’ll have to break out the script for a change.” The spirit removes its hand and stands up. “I am the Shepherd,” its hands gesture toward you, “and you are one of my many… well, I’ll say children. [[Pets-&gt;Prologue 3]] seems too...reductive.” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Prologue 4" tags="" position="514,56" size="100,100">The revelation washes over you. Your wagging tail. Your low, four-legged stature. The subtle feeling of fur across your body. You are, in fact, a dog. Well, the soul of a dog, anyway. The discovery is...comforting. [[You have an understanding of yourself-&gt;Prologue 5]] , or at least an understanding of your being. Your purpose, however, is still up in the air. The Shepherd smiles at you again.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Prologue 5" tags="" position="635,56" size="100,100">“I see you’re understanding it now! That’s good bud, that’s really good.” The Shepherd sits down on the ground, its face now level with yours. “Now, if I had things my way, you would stay here with me and we would have a grand old time,” the spirit scratches behind your ear again, “but if I do that, then I disrupt the Hierarchy, and since some of them are already mad at me anyway,” the spirit shakes its head, smiling “then the best thing to do is my job, which means making sure that you fulfill your [[purpose-&gt;Prologue 6]] as a dog.”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Prologue 6" tags="" position="757,54" size="100,100">Purpose. The word is heavy in the air. But the weight is good. It’s something you want, something you need, and though you don’t know exactly why, you excitedly wait for the Shepherd to explain it to you.

The Shepherd stands and clasps its hands together. “Well, time to get back on track. We’ve already gone over that you are a dog, but now it is important to understand what that means.” The spirit unclasps its hands to reveal a swirl of light in front of you. The light forms into images: wolves and humans hunting together in the early annals of [[history-&gt;Prologue 7]], dogs herding sheep in medieval fields, dogs pulling sleds through deep snow from town to town, and all between it, dogs spending time with their human companions, living their lives completely for their human counterpart. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Prologue 8" tags="" position="1018,50" size="100,100">The Shepherd waves its hands and the images disappear. “That is your purpose,” The spirit kneels down again, “to find and provide companionship to a human. It isn’t always easy to do, but usually everything falls into place. But the best way to provide companionship to another,” the Shepherd clasps its hands once again and then pulls them apart, revealing a pencil and clipboard, “is to understand oneself. So bud, I have some [[questions-&gt;Prologue 9]] for you.”
 </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Prologue 9" tags="" position="1016,203" size="100,100">“First, how would you describe yourself?”

Bringing energy is important, and energetic dogs are the source of much joy for humans.” The Shepherd leans in a bit closer. “Remember though, one-hundred percent energy isn’t the answer one-hundred percent of the time. Your human will need to pace themselves and so will you.” The Shepherd taps the top of your head. “But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Prologue 10.2" tags="" position="878,279" size="100,100">“Ah yes, loyalty is really important! It’s a point made in human culture that dogs are the most loyal animals that a human can own, so you’re definitely hitting a key mark with that.” The Shepherd leans in a bit closer. “But remember, while loyalty is important, it doesn’t do a lot of good without action to back it up. Standing by your owner is one thing. Helping them through their troubles is something else entirely.” The Shepherd taps the top of your head. “But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]]” 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Prologue 10.3" tags="" position="879,395" size="100,100">“Oh yes, caring for your owner is super important!

While it is important to care for your owner, you must also just be their friend. Let them enjoy your presence and have fun.” The Shepherd taps the top of your head. “But I should move onto the next [[question.-&gt; Prologue 11]] ”

It&#39;s early morning, but you’ve become an early bird. Your family isn’t the same. Your mother and siblings lay about you on the ground, snoring the dawn away. You on the other hand pop your head up and look out at the dawn. The sun peaks above the trees and covers the field in golden rays of light. The mud on the dirt road leading up to the house shines from the dewy morning. The [[lights of a car-&gt;Chapter 1: 3]] come into view.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Prologue 1" tags="" position="158,60" size="100,100">Your leg shakes involuntarily.

You,” the spirit taps your head, “are the spirit of an animal. Or, more accurately, you are the spirit of one of the most beloved animals in all of human history.” Your tail wags involuntarily. The Shepherd laughs, “That’s right, bud! [[You’re a dog!”-&gt;Prologue 4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Prologue 7" tags="" position="875,54" size="100,100">
The Shepherd smiles again as the images play out before both of you. “For generations, humans and dogs have been intertwined, their lives lived inseparably from one another. While the approach and context for each distinct relationship is very different, the purpose of it, the love and companionship, always finds its way through. Sometimes it does not always start out that way, but what is certain is that humans and dogs will always, at some point, find [[companionship-&gt;Prologue 8]]  with one another.” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Prologue 15" tags="" position="180,243" size="100,100">The Shepherd walks over and picks you up, your legs flailing a bit as it does. “Oh, uh, you can float by the way.” The Shepherd lets you go. Your body hangs in the air, your eyes watching the Shepherd as it takes its staff in both hands and thrusts it toward the sky. The space is pierced by a glowing golden portal. As you stare at it, the Shepherd grabs your face and looks you in the eye. “You’re gonna be a great dog, okay? You’re gonna make someone very happy. And who knows, maybe you’ll do it again and again. Now, up you go!” The Shepherd takes your body and throws you up into the portal. [[Your vision starts to spin-&gt; Chapter 1: 1]] as the portal sucks you through, and the last thing you see is the Shepherd waving at you.

Will is one of the few humans you routinely interact with. He’s a nice man; he feeds you, cleans up after you, and makes sure your brothers and sisters don’t bite you too much. You watch as he walks towards the oncoming car, its [[driver-&gt;  Chapter 1: 5]] slowing to a stop and getting out as Will reaches the driver side door.

Your brothers and sisters squirm a bit and begin to wake as you stare up at the driver. Will begins to explain the intricacies of your breed: how best to take care of you, what you like and don’t like, and everything in between.

You should [[have fun-&gt;Chapter 1: 13.2.1]] with your new friend.” Will wipes the tears from his eyes. “Okay, mom.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Chapter 1: 13.2b" tags="" position="1112.6666666666667,564.3333333333331" size="100,100">(set: $toy to &quot;train set&quot;)
 You take the lead car of the train set in your mouth and carry it over to the weeping Will. Dropping it in his lap, you look up at him, panting and wagging your tail. His mom smiles at you. “Look honey, the dog still wants to play. We’ll find Captain Beam. You should [[have fun-&gt;Chapter 1: 13.2.1]] with your new friend.” Will wipes the tears from his eyes. “Okay, mom.”

You take one of the small Lego men gently in your mouth and carry it over to the weeping Will. Dropping it in his lap, you look up at him, panting and wagging your tail. His mom smiles at you. “Look honey, the dog still wants to play. We’ll find Captain Beam.

Near the end of your playtime, his mom comes back into the room. Looking at you and then at him, she says, “You know Will, you should probably give the dog a [[name-&gt;Chapter 1: 14]] .”

You spend a lot more time with Will that day, and the next day, and the next, and the day after that. Eventually, your life passes you by as you watch Will grow up, your companionship growing with him day by day, until one day, [[you fall asleep-&gt;Chapter 1: 16]] on your dog bed…</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Chapter 1: 16" tags="" position="1821,662.6666666666665" size="100,100">“Hey bud!” You wake up to a familiar voice. The Shepherd looms over your spirit again. “So, it looks like your first run was a success!” He smiles at you as your spirit floats up again. “Now, I don’t need to explain to you what happened, and even if I did, I don’t really have the time to explain it to you. The only thing I will say is that, sadly, you won’t necessarily remember what happened to you the first time during this [[next time you go around-&gt;Chapter 1: 17]]. Maybe you will though. I certainly don’t make the rules when it comes to reincarnation, I just enforce them.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Chapter 1: 17" tags="" position="1821,812.6666666666665" size="100,100">(set: $ch1Breed to &quot;Breed&quot;)
“Now, while we don’t have to go through the whole process like we did the first time, we do have to have you select a new breed for yourself this time around. You’ve only got three options again, but they’re all new, so that’s nice! Anyway,” the clipboard appears in his hand, “What breed do you want this time?”

Now then,” the Shepherd forms the golden portal once again, “it’s time to send you back. I know, I know, this is a bit quick, but remember that quota I mentioned last time?
